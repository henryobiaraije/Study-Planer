### Notes ###
1. When an admin is studying the cards, cards in collections will note be filtered out due to known issues of WpAjax causing is_admin to return true even when in front end.


#### Question and Answers ####
1. A topic has 100 cards and I've not studied it but it says new cards to study is just 8, why?
    - Its probably because you added just 8 cards from that topic to your study deck.
